GENERAL RULES AND ENCODING:

Everything is based on the rhythm.

Rhythm:

Every Note has three Attributes:
Note or Rest							1Bit
Duration = (1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128) 		3Bit
Dottet or not							1Bit

=> Rhythm: 5Bit each

default rhythm: 4/4 no rests	



Melody - general succession of musical pitches:

chord or not 											2Bit	(2bit providing level of adjustment of complexity)
	if chord
	number of notes in chord:							3Bit	(2 3 4 5 6 2 3 4)
musical tone = C D E F G A B 							3Bit	000 = C
accidentals = sharp flat natural (double sharp) 		3Bit    rel: 1:1:4:1:1	(natural 4 times as likely)
			(double flat)
octave = (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7)								3Bit 	0 = 2
		 (-1 0 +1 +2 +3 +4)-treble						 		rel: 1:2:2:1:1:1 	(0 2 times as likely)
		 (-2 -1 0 1)-bass										rel: 1:4:2:1

=> Melody: 11Bit each note (+3Bit - once - if chord)



Articulation, Ornamentation and Dynamics:						(these might be referred to as simply 'artic' in the future)
Vorschlag, Vorhalt, 
accent, tenuto, expressivo, staccato, portato, turn,
trill, prall, mordent, fermata
ppp,pp,p,mp,mf,f,ff,fff,fp,sf,sp,sfz
crescendo, decrescendo 	+ 3Bits for how long
legato begin + legato end
arpeggio (if chord else ignore)

=> 29 different expressions (5Bit)	+ 1Bit for none -> 	6Bit	


beat := sound or silence

STEPS FOR GENERATING .ly File:
	1.Rhythm is generated from Bitstring.
	for each beat in rhythm:
		if beat is not rest:
			add next note from melody
			add next art/orn/dyn

=> next beat/note/(art/orn/dyn) decoded by cutting off first x bits from rhythm/melody/AOD string and interpreting them



=> rhythm/melody/Art.. strings have constant lengths

LENGTHS:
Rhythm 				200 Sounds/Silences			=> 500 Bits
melody 				xxx Notes					=> 15000 Bit (enough after testing)
Art/Orn/Dyn 		400							=> 2400 Bit  


Complexity levels: 
rhythm: 1 2 3 4
melody: 1 2 3 4 5 6
