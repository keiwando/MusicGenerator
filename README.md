# MusicGenerator
A Flask Web Application that generates sheet music randomly or based on input (or a combination of both). 
Music engraving done by Lilypond.

# Example

Enter a sequence of notes and let the rythm be randomly generated for you - or vice versa. There are also different complexity
levels for rhythm, melody and expression.

Note: 
Not really intended for writing long and complex pieces by input. More as something for fun/inspiration
